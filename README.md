# Project Overview 
This repository is a collection of deliverables and reports created for Achievement 6 of the Career Foundry Data Analytics program. For this project, I chose my own data set (UFC Fight historical data 1993-2021) and used advanced analytics to explore the data and find connections between different variables.

# Objectives and Analysis Criteria
Objective: To build an interactive dashboard that will visually showcase well-curated results of an advanced exploratory analysis conducted in Python.
Analysis Criteria:

    Exploratory analysis through visualizations
    Geospatial analysis using a shapefile
    Regression analysis
    Cluster analysis
    Time-series analysis
    Analysis narrative and final results
